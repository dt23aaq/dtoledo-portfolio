          <h2>Introduction to Data & Database Modelling</h2>
          <p><span>Week 1 & 2</span></p>
          <p>
            During my data & database management course, I gained an understanding of Entity Relationship (ER) modelling in SQL, which is a powerful tool for creating effective and well-organised databases.
          </p><p>
            ER modelling involves visually representing entities, attributes, and relationships between them.
          </p><p>
            This technique provides a clearer understanding of complex data structures.
          </p><p>
            I learned how to apply ER modelling in SQL to design a database schema, and also identify potential data anomalies and inconsistencies that may impact data integrity.
          </p><p>
            Furthermore, the course equipped me with the skills to use SQL to query and manipulate data based on my ER model.
          </p><p>
            As a result, I can extract valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.
            In summary, this course provided me with a strong understanding of ER modelling using SQL, which is an important skill for the future job.
